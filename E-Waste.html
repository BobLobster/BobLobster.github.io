<h1>E-Waste</h1>
<p>iPhone is one of the most used device in the world. Apple has created a device that is loved by many and it’s an alarming issue when there are so many being made each year. The iPhone 6 and 6+ alone are making 540,000 units each day! </p>
<p>Question is, where are they all going when they're no longer being used by people. Well, it depends, some people store them away and keep them running around the house and some throw them in the bins. That's a problem when phones are being burried in our grounds when they could be reused since they can easily be pulled apart. </p>
<p>Luckily there are solutions, Apple themselves have their own waste solution called the ‘Apple Renew Program’  so they're recycled properly and reused and many others are following in their footsteps to help deal with this issue. </p>
