<h1>Future Generation</h1>
<p>iPhone 38, different to the current phones yet very similar. This phone is similar the current ones, it's the size of a 7 but has many more features such as brain connectivity, which allows the phone owner to connect their mind into the phone.</p>
<p>It has default apps such as an app to open your house door using finger print scanner. The camera is crystal clear, as good as the human eye and brightness can be changed from extremely low to very high unlike the restricted current phones.
